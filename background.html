      <p>Rumah Aman’s story starts with Mr Abdul Rehman Dakri and his wife. They had always had a dream of opening an orphanage after they retired, and they took every step needed towards achieving this wish, finally starting Rumah Aman here in Malaysia. They founded the home in 2005, and started with less than 10 boys. Their first location was in Seksyen 2 Shah Alam.</p>
      
      <p>Later they moved their base of operations to Saujana Utama. The home in Shah Alam Seksyen 2 is a children’s home for 19 girls and 4 preschool boys. The headquarters in Saujana Utama is home to 45 boys, currently between 7 to 16 years of age, and also serves as the children’s school. As of March 2018, Rumah Aman is home to almost 70 children.</p>

      <p>Mr and Mrs Dakri have completely dedicated themselves to the well-being of the children and will continue to do so for the foresee-able future.</p>
      
      <p>“Do not discount anyone in life, there is always someone better than you and always someone worse than you. But, if you focus on the worst, you’ll forget the good.” </p>
